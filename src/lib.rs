//! This crate provides a powerful and intuitive way to perform string brace expansion.
//! Brace expansion is a feature commonly found in shells and text processing tools,
//! allowing you to generate all possible combinations of strings specified within
//! curly braces.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - **Simple and Easy-to-Use**: With the bracoxide crate, expanding brace patterns in
//! strings becomes a breeze. Just pass in your input string, and the crate will
//! generate all possible combinations for you.
//!
//! - **Flexible Brace Expansion**: The crate supports various brace expansion patterns,
//! including numeric ranges ({0..9}), comma-separated options ({red,green,blue}),
//! nested expansions ({a{b,c}d}, {x{1..3},y{4..6}}), and more.
//!
//! - **Robust Error Handling**: The crate provides detailed error handling, allowing you
//! to catch and handle any issues that may arise during the tokenization and expansion
//! process.
//!
//! - **Lightweight and Fast**: Designed to be efficient and performant, ensuring quick
//! and reliable string expansion operations.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! To start using the bracoxide crate, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! bracoxide = "0.1.0"
//! ```
//!
//! We hope you find the str expand crate to be a valuable tool in your Rust projects.
//! Happy string expansion!
