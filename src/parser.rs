//! Provides functions and types for parsing tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The parser module is responsible for transforming a sequence of tokens into a structured AST representation.
//! It takes the output of the tokenizer and performs the necessary parsing operations to generate the AST nodes.
//! The AST can then be used for further processing, interpretation, or code generation.

/// Represents a node in the parsed AST.
///
/// The `Node` enum captures different elements in the parsed abstract syntax tree (AST).
/// It includes variants for representing text, brace expansions, and ranges.
pub enum Node {
    /// Represents a text node.
    /// It contains the text value and the starting position of the text.
    Text(String, usize),
    /// Represents a brace expansion node.
    /// It includes the prefix, inside, and outside nodes, along with the
    /// starting positions.
    BraceExpansion(
        Option<Vec<Node>>, // Prefix nodes
        Vec<Node>, // Inside nodes
        Option<Vec<Node>>, // Postfix nodes
        usize // Starting position
    ),
    /// Represents a range node.
    /// It contains the starting and ending numbers of the range, along with the
    /// starting position.
    Range(String, String, usize)
}

/// Represents an error that can occur during parsing.
///
/// The `ParsingError` enum captures different error scenarios that can happen during parsing.
pub enum ParsingError {
    /// Indicates that there are no tokens to parse.
    NoTokens,
    /// Indicates an unpredicted parsing error.
    Unpredicted
}

/// Parses a sequence of tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
///
/// The `parse` function takes a vector of tokens as input and performs the parsing operation.
/// It returns a result with the parsed AST nodes on success, or a specific error on failure.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `tokens` - A vector of tokens to be parsed.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Result<Vec<Node>, ParsingError>` - A result containing the parsed AST nodes or an error.
